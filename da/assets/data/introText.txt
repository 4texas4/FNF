if you can listen to this--you are deaf in the ears
screw my ears!--*insert perfectly cut scream*
it's too jumbly--it has way too much in it
writing is fine--but EQ is trash
i heard this song before--*turns into a vegetable*
shoutout to--KharaReal
is that frisk from "Undertale"?--*earrape incoming*
"when you hit night fi-"--why am i singing along to it?
it's trash--then why are you singing?
i'm singing it ironically--doesn't matter, you're singing
"end was surely near"--I HOPE
been doing songs for years--time to listen to songs
into the mouth--NOICE
HEY--that's my cabbage
are you proud of yourself?--you nosy little fu-
now you have to believe--i BeLiEvE
please kill me now--i'm bleeding
