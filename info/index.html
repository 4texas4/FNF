<p><strong>NONE OF THESE MODS I HAVE MADE. LET ME GET THAT CLEAR.</strong></p>
<p>why this github exists<p>
<p>one day I was playing fnf on some silly website and I decided<p>
<p> that I would port over mods because I found out that most chromebooks can run the kade engine version of the game in browser pretty smoothly, combined with image compression.<p>
<p>I hope this makes your day just a little bit better, being able to play fnf mods on lower end devices.<p>
<p>and to the people who create these mods, thank you so much, I would be bored of fnf by now lol.<p>
<p>and also wow I suck at html lol<p>
